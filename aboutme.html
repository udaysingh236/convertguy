			<p> Hello there..!! My name is Uday Singh and preferably I would like to 
				call myself a backend devloper as you can notice my less interest in frontend
 				from the website's UI hahhahah..!!!
 				<br>
 				<br>
 				I am learning and working on both back and front end from the past 4 years with a 
 				reputed firm. My hobbies are loving my girlfriend, playing volleyball, travelling 
 				in my free time which I get very rarely and my girlfriend always complains about it.

				I am a computer freak and like challenges. I have a great sense of humour and apart from some of the appraisals I have earned a good bunch of colleagues in my life.   	
			 	
			 	<br>	
		 		<br>
			 	I have hands on experience on linux, Javascript, nodejs, C, MONGO DB, COUCHBASE DB, Amazon Web Services and web hosting.
